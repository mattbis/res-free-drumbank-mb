### free to use - no time for anything else today...
1. quickly generated for somebody to use, and some old ones from teh archive ( shame I cant use the generator was great back in the day )
2. could generate a metric ton of these... they dont take long; ( although one should argue that they are dry and I should give you WetFX )
3. should use collider and pd probably 

#### attribute `@mattbis` would be nice ... ( if its public )
